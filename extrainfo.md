# Prior Information

This file contains additional context and background information related to the **Step Sync** library.

## Development Philosophy

The **StepSync** library was developed with the goal of offering a **simple and accessible** solution for counting steps using sensor data. As a more **self-taught backend developer** with limited expertise in **advanced algorithms** and **mathematics**, my intention was to create a library that can be easily understood and used by those with little experience in these areas. 

I focused on providing a **minimalist API** that allows developers to quickly integrate step detection into their apps without needing to worry about complex configurations or fine-tuning algorithms.

## Why Keep It Simple

While there are more advanced health tracking libraries (like **Health**), they often come with **higher complexity** and require more configuration. **StepSync** focuses on **ease of use** and **quick integration**, which makes it perfect for beginners or those working on small projects that don't need extensive health metrics or highly precise data.

### Trade-offs: Simplicity vs Accuracy

- **Pros**: Easy-to-use, minimal setup, perfect for basic step tracking.
- **Cons**: Not as **accurate** or **feature-rich** as more advanced libraries, like those used in professional fitness apps.

If you need features like **heart rate integration**, **GPS tracking**, or **advanced customization**, consider using more robust health libraries or provide a request i will try to implement but cannot promise anything.

## Algorithm Insights

I leveraged basic **vector math** and **sensor data** to track steps. Most of the algorithmic work was based on general patterns found across the internet. The more **complex mathematical parts** were supported using AI tools, but I implemented everything in **Dart** myself. The goal was to create something effective yet simple.

## Acknowledgments

The algorithms used in this library were gathered from various **internet resources** and my own learning. For more complex sections (especially those involving math), I used **AI tools** to assist me in overcoming obstacles. Contributions, especially from people with expertise in **step-counting algorithms** or **health data**, are highly encouraged.

## Future Goals

The library will be continuously updated with improvements. Here are some potential enhancements:
- More **accurate step detection** algorithms.
- **Customization options** for different user types (e.g., sensitivity adjustments).
- **Integration with other health data** for more advanced use cases.

## Call for Contributions

This library is open to contributions! If you have ideas for improving the algorithm, adding features, or refining the library, feel free to submit issues or pull requests. Special contributions are welcome from those experienced in **sensor data**, **mathematical modeling**, or **health-related technologies**.

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaborating or have any suggestions!
